# Project Requirements Document: Cookie Decliner Browser Extension

The following table outlines the detailed functional requirements of the Cookie Decliner browser extension.

| Requirement ID | Description | User Story | Expected Behavior/Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| FR001 | Automatic Cookie Popup Detection | As a user, I want the extension to automatically detect cookie consent popups when I visit websites so I don't have to manually identify them. | The system should scan the page for common cookie consent frameworks (SourcePoint, Cookiebot, OneTrust, Usercentrics) and custom implementations using DOM analysis, TCF API detection, and iframe monitoring. |
| FR002 | Multi-Language Cookie Button Recognition | As a user visiting websites in different languages, I want the extension to recognize decline buttons in Norwegian, English, German, and French so it works across international sites. | The system should identify cookie decline buttons using text patterns like "Avvis alle", "Reject all", "Alle ablehnen", "Tout refuser" and their variations, including context-aware detection. |
| FR003 | TCF API Integration | As a user visiting sites with TCF v2.0 compliance, I want the extension to use the standard Transparency & Consent Framework API to decline consent programmatically when available. | The system should detect and use the `__tcfapi` function to decline all purposes and vendors, handling both immediate API availability and delayed loading scenarios. |
| FR004 | SourcePoint Framework Support | As a user visiting sites using SourcePoint CMP, I want the extension to communicate with SourcePoint iframes and APIs to decline consent automatically. | The system should detect SourcePoint implementations through iframe patterns, message IDs, and `_sp_` objects, sending appropriate decline messages and handling cross-frame communication. |
| FR005 | Universal Framework Compatibility | As a user, I want the extension to work with major cookie consent frameworks (Cookiebot, OneTrust, Usercentrics) so it functions on most websites. | The system should provide framework-specific selectors and APIs for each major consent management platform, using their documented decline methods and button identifiers. |
| FR006 | Intelligent Button Context Detection | As a user, I want the extension to avoid clicking non-cookie buttons (like login or newsletter buttons) so it only interacts with actual consent management interfaces. | The system should analyze button context, parent elements, and surrounding text to ensure only cookie-related decline buttons are clicked, excluding sign-in and other unrelated actions. |
| FR007 | Dynamic Content Monitoring | As a user visiting sites with dynamically loaded cookie popups, I want the extension to detect and handle popups that appear after page load or user interaction. | The system should use MutationObserver to monitor DOM changes and detect cookie-related content additions, responding to late-loading consent management interfaces. |
| FR008 | Cross-Frame Communication | As a user visiting sites with iframe-based cookie systems, I want the extension to communicate across frames to decline consent in embedded cookie management interfaces. | The system should handle postMessage communication between parent pages and cookie consent iframes, supporting various message formats and protocols. |
| FR009 | Consent Processing State Management | As a user, I want the extension to stop processing once consent has been successfully declined to avoid duplicate actions and excessive resource usage. | The system should track consent processing state, immediately halt all scanning and API calls after successful decline, and disconnect observers to prevent redundant operations. |
| FR010 | Multiple Attempt Strategy | As a user visiting sites with complex loading sequences, I want the extension to make multiple attempts at different intervals to ensure cookie popups are caught regardless of loading timing. | The system should implement a multi-tier approach with immediate, 2-second, 5-second, and 10-second attempts, each with early exit conditions to optimize performance. |
| FR011 | Universal Domain Support | As a user visiting websites across different countries and domains, I want the extension to work on any site regardless of the domain or cookie consent provider used. | The system should use generic detection patterns for consent domains (sourcepoint, cmp, consent) and message formats, avoiding hardcoded site-specific implementations. |
| FR012 | Browser Compatibility | As a user of different browsers, I want the extension to work in both Chrome (Manifest V3) and Firefox (Manifest V2) so I can use it regardless of my browser choice. | The system should provide browser-specific manifest files and handle API differences between Chrome extensions and Firefox add-ons while maintaining identical functionality. |
| FR013 | Performance Optimization | As a user, I want the extension to use minimal system resources and stop unnecessary processing after successful consent handling. | The system should implement exponential backoff for API checks, early returns for completed processing, and observer disconnection to minimize CPU usage and memory consumption. |
| FR014 | Popup Interface | As a user, I want a simple popup interface to confirm the extension is active and working on the current page. | The system should provide a browser action popup showing extension status, current URL awareness, and confirmation that cookie consent processing is active. |
| FR015 | Shadow DOM Support | As a user visiting sites with shadow DOM elements, I want the extension to detect and interact with cookie buttons that may be encapsulated in shadow roots. | The system should scan shadow DOM trees for cookie-related buttons and handle consent decline within shadow DOM contexts. |
| FR016 | Error Handling and Resilience | As a user, I want the extension to handle errors gracefully and continue functioning even when individual websites have unusual implementations. | The system should implement try-catch blocks around all major operations, provide fallback methods when primary approaches fail, and continue operation despite individual site incompatibilities. |
| FR017 | Cookie Context Validation | As a user, I want the extension to verify that buttons are actually related to cookie consent before clicking them to avoid unintended actions. | The system should implement multi-layer validation including text analysis, class/ID inspection, parent element context, and keyword matching to ensure cookie relevance. |
| FR018 | Extension Lifecycle Management | As a user, I want the extension to properly clean up resources and stop background processes when consent processing is complete or when the extension is disabled. | The system should provide proper cleanup methods to disconnect observers, clear timeouts, and remove event listeners to prevent memory leaks and unnecessary background activity. |
